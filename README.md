#### Prerequisite knowledge/ Prework:

Prerequisite knowledge: See topic list and Learn.co material above. This activity should be used after students have finished the Learn.co material above.

Prework: Instructor should send out this survey link to students a few hours before the lecture: https://forms.gle/EhiZgteayncD7Whv7. Give them a deadline to submit one hour before lecture. Download a csv of responses from Google Forms (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WYGnY0anHFJrYQfPRLpyOfl5HGXvhnyO_HldlI_pLeo/edit#responses) and save to student-facing repository before lecture.

#### Learning goals for this lesson:
1. Use NetworkX to visualize and analyze a network
2. Describe networks using concepts such as connectivity, centrality and communities
3. Use descriptive information about graphs to make real-world recommendations

#### Misconceptions:
See "Notes About Today's Activity" Slide:

- I have no idea what our class network actually looks like â€“ it could be weird
- You have a fair amount of leeway to interpret/answer some of the questions in the notebook. Feel free to be creative! 
- If you get stuck, there are hints at the bottom of the notebook
- Task 5 asks you to make recommendations to me for improving class cohesion. I promise to listen to your recommendations, but not necessarily to use them


#### Materials
- Survey (see links in Prework above)
- Student-facing repository (TBD, notebook and slides in this repository)

## Lesson Outline:

See slides for additional detail. Notes on each slide provide presentation tips.

**Step**: Problem <br/>
**Time**: 10 min

_Goal/Scenario:_<br/>
Make recommendations to me, as your teacher, about how to improve class cohesion.

_Learning Goals in sequence:_<br/>
1. Use NetworkX to visualize and analyze a network
2. Describe networks using concepts such as connectivity, centrality and communities
3. Use descriptive information about graphs to make real-world recommendations


**Step**: Activation <br/>
**Time**: 0 min

On "Do you all talk to each other?" slide, connect to their personal experience as a member of the class and the previous work they have done on graph theory. 

**Step**: Learning Goals 1, 2 and 3, and Integration:  <br/>
**Time**: 35 + 15 = 50 min

Students work in pairs to complete tasks in Jupyter notebook related to the three goals and integrating the answers to generate recommendations. Pairs then join to form groups of 4 that discuss and prepare to share recommendations.

**Step**: Assessment:  <br/>
**Time**: 20 min

Groups share out recommendations and supporting findings.

**Step**: Reflection:  <br/>
**Time**: 10 min

Group discussion using questions on Discussion slide.
